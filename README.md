This repository contains files and datasets needed to investigate and visualise the infulence that activation functions have on the efficiency and effectiveness of the custom build artificial neural network.
It trains on 5 different datasets alongside with 4 different activation functions being implemented.
For each dataset the results are harvested by collecting MSE data for a range of epochs, starting from 20, going all the way up to 1000 in increments of 20.
